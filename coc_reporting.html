<h1>PySAL Code of Conduct - How to follow up on a report<a class="headerlink" href="#pysal-code-of-conduct-how-to-follow-up-on-a-report" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This is the manual followed by PySAL’s Code of Conduct Committee. It’s
used when we respond to an issue to make sure we’re consistent and fair.</p>
<p>Enforcing the Code of Conduct impacts our community today and for the
future. It’s an action that we do not take lightly. When reviewing
enforcement measures, the Code of Conduct Committee will keep the
following values and guidelines in mind:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Act in a personal manner rather than impersonal. The Committee can
engage the parties to understand the situation, while respecting the
privacy and any necessary confidentiality of reporters. However,
sometimes it is necessary to communicate with one or more individuals
directly: the Committee’s goal is to improve the health of our
community rather than only produce a formal decision.</li>
<li>Emphasize empathy for individuals rather than judging behavior,
avoiding binary labels of “good” and “bad/evil”. Overt, clear-cut
aggression and harassment exists and we will be address that firmly.
But many scenarios that can prove challenging to resolve are those
where normal disagreements devolve into unhelpful or harmful behavior
from multiple parties. Understanding the full context and finding a
path that re-engages all is hard, but ultimately the most productive
for our community.</li>
<li>We understand that email is a difficult medium and can be isolating.
Receiving criticism over email, without personal contact, can be
particularly painful. This makes it especially important to keep an
atmosphere of open-minded respect of the views of others. It also
means that we must be transparent in our actions, and that we will do
everything in our power to make sure that all our members are treated
fairly and with sympathy.</li>
<li>Discrimination can be subtle and it can be unconscious. It can show
itself as unfairness and hostility in otherwise ordinary
interactions. We know that this does occur, and we will take care to
look out for it. We would very much like to hear from you if you feel
you have been treated unfairly, and we will use these procedures to
make sure that your complaint is heard and addressed.</li>
<li>Help increase engagement in good discussion practice: try to identify
where discussion may have broken down and provide actionable
information, pointers and resources that can lead to positive change
on these points.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the needs of new members: provide them with explicit
support and consideration, with the aim of increasing participation
from underrepresented groups in particular.</li>
<li>Individuals come from different cultural backgrounds and native
languages. Try to identify any honest misunderstandings caused by a
non-native speaker and help them understand the issue and what they
can change to avoid causing offence. Complex discussion in a foreign
language can be very intimidating, and we want to grow our diversity
also across nationalities and cultures.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mediation</em>: voluntary, informal mediation is a tool at our disposal. In
contexts such as when two or more parties have all escalated to the
point of inappropriate behavior (something sadly common in human
conflict), it may be useful to facilitate a mediation process. This is
only an example: the Committee can consider mediation in any case,
mindful that the process is meant to be strictly voluntary and no party
can be pressured to participate. If the Committee suggests mediation, it
should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Find a candidate who can serve as a mediator.</li>
<li>Obtain the agreement of the reporter(s). The reporter(s) have
complete freedom to decline the mediation idea, or to propose an
alternate mediator.</li>
<li>Obtain the agreement of the reported person(s).</li>
<li>Settle on the mediator: while parties can propose a different
mediator than the suggested candidate, only if common agreement is
reached on all terms can the process move forward.</li>
<li>Establish a timeline for mediation to complete, ideally within two
weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mediator will engage with all the parties and seek a resolution that
is satisfactory to all. Upon completion, the mediator will provide a
report (vetted by all parties to the process) to the Committee, with
recommendations on further steps. The Committee will then evaluate these
results (whether satisfactory resolution was achieved or not) and decide
on any additional action deemed necessary.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-the-committee-will-respond-to-reports">
<h2>How the committee will respond to reports<a class="headerlink" href="#how-the-committee-will-respond-to-reports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the committee (or a committee member) receives a report, they will
first determine whether the report is about a clear and severe breach
(as defined below). If so, immediate action needs to be taken in
addition to the regular report handling process.</p>
<div class="section" id="clear-and-severe-breach-actions">
<h3>Clear and severe breach actions<a class="headerlink" href="#clear-and-severe-breach-actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start
at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We will deal quickly with
clear and severe breaches like personal threats, violent, sexist or
racist language.</p>
<p>When a member of the Code of Conduct committee becomes aware of a clear
and severe breach, they will do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Immediately disconnect the originator from all PySAL communication
channels.</li>
<li>Reply to the reporter that their report has been received and that
the originator has been disconnected.</li>
<li>In every case, the moderator should make a reasonable effort to
contact the originator, and tell them specifically how their language
or actions qualify as a “clear and severe breach”. The moderator
should also say that, if the originator believes this is unfair or
they want to be reconnected to PySAL, they have the right to ask for
a review, as below, by the Code of Conduct Committee. The moderator
should copy this explanation to the Code of Conduct Committee.</li>
<li>The Code of Conduct Committee will formally review and sign off on
all cases where this mechanism has been applied to make sure it is
not being used to control ordinary heated disagreement.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="report-handling">
<h3>Report handling<a class="headerlink" href="#report-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a report is sent to the committee they will immediately reply to
the reporter to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 72
hours, and the group should strive to respond much quicker than that.</p>
<p>If a report doesn’t contain enough information, the committee will
obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is empowered to
act on the Steering Council’s behalf in contacting any individuals
involved to get a more complete account of events.</p>
<p>The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best
of their ability:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What happened.</li>
<li>Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.</li>
<li>Who are the responsible party(ies).</li>
<li>Whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to
anyone’s physical safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
group’s deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. chat
transcripts, email discussions, recorded conference calls, summaries of
voice conversations, etc).</p>
<p>It is important to retain an archive of all activities of this committee
to ensure consistency in behavior and provide institutional memory for
the project. To assist in this, the default channel of discussion for
this committee will be a private mailing list accessible to current and
future members of the committee as well as members of the Steering
Council upon justified request. If the Committee finds the need to use
off-list communications (e.g. phone calls for early/rapid response), it
should in all cases summarize these back to the list so there’s a good
record of the process.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct Committee should aim to have a resolution agreed
upon within two weeks. In the event that a resolution can’t be
determined in that time, the committee will respond to the reporter(s)
with an update and projected timeline for resolution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resolutions">
<h2>Resolutions<a class="headerlink" href="#resolutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group
cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will
turn the matter over to the Steering Council for resolution.</p>
<p>Possible responses may include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Taking no further action</li>
<li>if we determine no violations have occurred.</li>
<li>if the matter has been resolved publicly while the committee was
considering responses.</li>
<li>Coordinating voluntary mediation: if all involved parties agree, the
Committee may facilitate a mediation process as detailed above.</li>
<li>Remind publicly, and point out that some behavior/actions/language
have been judged inappropriate and why in the current context, or can
but hurtful to some people, requesting the community to self-adjust.</li>
<li>A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved.
In this case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the
individual(s) over email, cc’ing the group.</li>
<li>A public reprimand. In this case, the committee chair will deliver
that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred, within
the limits of practicality. E.g., the original mailing list for an
email violation, but for a chat room discussion where the
person/context may be gone, they can be reached by other means. The
group may choose to publish this message elsewhere for documentation
purposes.</li>
<li>A request for a public or private apology, assuming the reporter
agrees to this idea: they may at their discretion refuse further
contact with the violator. The chair will deliver this request. The
committee may, if it chooses, attach “strings” to this request: for
example, the group may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain
one’s membership on a mailing list.</li>
<li>A “mutually agreed upon hiatus” where the committee asks the
individual to temporarily refrain from community participation. If
the individual chooses not to take a temporary break voluntarily, the
committee may issue a “mandatory cooling off period”.</li>
<li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all PySAL spaces (mailing
lists, gitter.im, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such
bans so that they may be reviewed in the future or otherwise
maintained.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the
committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected
parties and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if
this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.</p>
<p>Finally, the committee will make a report to the PySAL Steering Council
(as well as the PySAL core team in the event of an ongoing resolution,
such as a ban).</p>
<p>The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public
statements will be made by the chair of the Code of Conduct Committee.</p>

<div class="section" id="conflicts-of-interest">
<h2>Conflicts of Interest<a class="headerlink" href="#conflicts-of-interest" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the event of any conflict of interest, a committee member must
immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if
necessary.</p>
