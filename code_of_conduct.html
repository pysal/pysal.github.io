<h1>PySAL Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#pysal-code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the PySAL project,
including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis,
blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our
community. The PySAL project does not organise in-person events, however
events related to our community should have a code of conduct similar in
spirit to this one.</p>
<p>This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in
the PySAL community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation
with the project, in any project-related activities and especially when
representing the project, in any role.</p>
<p>This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please
try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a
friendly and productive environment that enriches the surrounding
community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="specific-guidelines">
<h2>Specific Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#specific-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We strive to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer
to use public methods of communication for project-related messages,
unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for
help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support
request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it
also ensures that any inadvertent mistakes in answering are more
easily detected and corrected.</li>
<li>Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to
resolve conflict, and assume good intentions. We may all experience
some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration
to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel
uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</li>
<li>Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn
we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the
benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it
works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any
decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those
consequences seriously when making decisions.</li>
<li>Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early
avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we
may direct them to the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be
responsive and helpful.</li>
<li>Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful
in our communication and we take responsibility for our own speech.
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. We
will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behaviour, such as:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally
identifying information (“doxing”).</li>
<li>Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or
non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history, without
the sender’s consent.</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Excessive profanity. Please avoid swearwords; people differ greatly
in their sensitivity to swearing.</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
stop, then stop.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="diversity-statement">
<h2>Diversity Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#diversity-statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The PySAL project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We
are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of.
Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individual’s
preferences, we try our best to treat everyone kindly.</p>
<p>No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we
welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly
honour diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity
or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype,
political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability, to the extent
that these do not conflict with this code of conduct.</p>
<p>Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, PySAL development is
conducted in English.</p>
<p>Standards for behaviour in the PySAL community are detailed in the Code
of Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these
standards in all their interactions and help others to do so as well
(see next section).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reporting-guidelines">
<h2>Reporting Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start
at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We also recognize that
sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the
guidelines in this Code of Conduct. Please keep this in mind when
deciding on how to respond to a breach of this Code.</p>
<p>For clearly intentional breaches, report those to the Code of Conduct
committee (see below). For possibly unintentional breaches, you may
reply to the person and point out this code of conduct (either in public
or in private, whatever is most appropriate). If you would prefer not to
do that, please feel free to report to the Code of Conduct Committee
directly, or ask the Committee for advice, in confidence.</p>
<p>You can report issues to the PySAL Code of Conduct committee at
<strong>pysal-conduct&#64;googlegroups.com</strong>[create group and add link] or
<strong>pysal/CoC</strong>[create group and add link]. Currently, the committee
consists of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Stefanie Lumnitz<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="mailto:stefanie&#46;lumnitz&#37;&#52;&#48;gmail&#46;com">stefanie<span>&#46;</span>lumnitz<span>&#64;</span>gmail<span>&#46;</span>com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>James Gaboardi<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="mailto:jgaboardi&#37;&#52;&#48;gmail&#46;com">jgaboardi<span>&#64;</span>gmail<span>&#46;</span>com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Serge Rey<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="mailto:sergio&#46;rey&#37;&#52;&#48;ucr&#46;edu">sergio<span>&#46;</span>rey<span>&#64;</span>ucr<span>&#46;</span>edu</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your report involves any members of the committee, or if they feel
they have a conflict of interest in handling it, then they will recuse
themselves from considering your report. Alternatively, if for any
reason you feel uncomfortable making a report to the committee, then you
can also contact:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>somebody other than pysaler 1, Stefanie, or James</strong></li>
<li><strong>Julia Kochinsky is the current front runner</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Incident reporting resolution &amp; Code of Conduct enforcement<a class="headerlink" href="#incident-reporting-resolution-code-of-conduct-enforcement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>This section summarizes the most important points, more details can be
found in the</em> <a class="reference external" href="coc_reporting.html">Code of Conduct Reporting Manual</a>.</p>
<p>We will investigate and respond to all complaints. The <strong>PySAL Code of
Conduct Committee</strong> will protect the identity of the reporter, and treat
the content of complaints as confidential (unless the reporter agrees
otherwise).</p>
<p>In case of severe and obvious breaches, e.g. personal threat or violent,
sexist or racist language, we will immediately disconnect the originator
from PySAL communication channels; please see the manual for details.</p>
<p>In cases not involving clear severe and obvious breaches of this code of
conduct, the process for acting on any received code of conduct
violation report will be:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>acknowledge report is received</li>
<li>reasonable discussion/feedback</li>
<li>mediation (if feedback didn’t help, and only if both reporter and
reportee agree to this)</li>
<li>enforcement via transparent decision (see <a class="reference external" href="coc_reporting.html">Code of Conduct Reporting
Manual</a>) by the Code of Conduct Committee</li>
</ol>
<p>The committee will respond to any report as soon as possible, and at
most within 72 hours.</p>
