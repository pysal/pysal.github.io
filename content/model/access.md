description: "Access makes the new spatial access metric RAAM available and allows for comparison bewteen RAAM and classic spatial access models. It supports spatial access research scale by making pre-computed travel time matrices available and sharing code for computing new matrices at scale, and allows users who prefer a point-and-click interface to obtain spatial access results for their data using our web app (for US)."
