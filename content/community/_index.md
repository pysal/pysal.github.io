PySAL has always been and will always be an open source project. As such, we welcome every contributor to the PySAL community. [We]() strive to create a collaborative environment where we can, together, build the best spatial analysis library possible, while having fun along the way.

To ensure that the PySAL community is the realization of these ideals, we expect all members of the community to abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/pysal/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.rst).

## Getting Involved
There are many ways to contribute to PySAL. A great starting point is to join our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/pysal/pysal) where much of the day-to-day discussion between developers as well as users takes place.

If you are new to open source development and interested in programming for spatial data science, we are happy to offer mentoring opportunities. Let us know of your interest by joining the gitter channel and introducing yourself to the community.

If you have questions about how to contribute code to PySAL, please see our [development guidelines](https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki).

To learn about the current and future directions of the project, we record and post the [notes of our monthly developer meetings](https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/Developer-meetings) which may be helpful.
